# RDO-GG-Tunables
Source code for the RDO.GG tunables site.

## Want to contribute?
You can contribute by updating any of the data files that the website uses to display data. You can find the files you can update in `/public/data/`.
Please note that each of the files are required to be in their original format, unless you also update the code that reads the files.
You can find a short explanation of what each data file does below:

- **daily_objectives.json:** Contains an ordered array of all possible Daily Objectives in GTA V.
- **hsw_time_trials.json:** Contains an ordered array of the names of all HSW Time Trials in GTA V.
- **rc_time_trials.json:** Contains an ordered array of the names of all RC Bandito Time Trials in GTA V.
- **time_trials.json:** Contains an ordered array of the names of all Time Trials in GTA V.
- **tunable_defaults.json:** Contains an object of all tunables defaults in GTA V.
- **tunable_types.json:** Contains an unordered array of the tunable types used for displaying sales and bonuses in GTA V.
- **vehicles.json:** Contains an object of all vehicle names in GTA V.
- **weapons.json:** Contains an object of all weapon names in GTA V.

Before touching any of these files, take your time to familiarize yourself with the file itself. Please ensure that the JSON is valid and, again, uses to original format.
In general, I don't expect these files will need many updates, unless GTA V updates. The file I need the most help with for now is **tunable_types.json**.
